# SIC/XE Assembler

## Overview
- The `sicasm.c` program implements a two-pass assembler for the SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) machine architecture.
- The `sicxeasm.c` program implements a two-pass assembler for the SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer with Extra Equipment) machine architecture.
- SIC/XE is a hypothetical computer system introduced in *System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming*, by Leland Beck [1].
- Both programs read an assembly language program for the SIC or SIC/XE machines respectively, processes it, and produces two output files:
  - Listing File: This file contains the source code along with the corresponding object code (in hexadecimal) generated for each statement. It also includes a symbol table that lists all symbols and their corresponding addresses after the assembly process.
  - Object Code File: This file contains the final object code generated by the assembler, formatted according to SIC/XE standards. It includes a Header record, Text records, and an End record.
- The program handles basic directives and opcodes in the SIC/XE instruction set and performs error checking during both passes of the assembly process.

## Features
- Pass 1:
  - Parses the assembly source code to generate a symbol table and track location counters.
  - Checks for duplicate symbols and invalid opcodes.
- Pass 2:
  - Generates object code based on the symbol table and processes each statement.
  - Checks for undefined symbols and errors related to operand formats.
- Supported Directives: START, BYTE, WORD, RESB, RESW, END, BASE, NOBASE
- Supported Opcodes: A range of SIC/XE machine opcodes such as ADD, SUB, LDA, STA, JSUB, RD, TD, RSUB, and more.
- Input Format: The source file is a text file containing assembly instructions, comments, labels, opcodes, and operands formatted according to SIC/XE conventions.
- Output Format:
  1. A listing file containing:
    - Line numbers
    - Location counter values
    - Source statements
    - Object code
    - Symbol table
  2. An object file containing the final assembled object code.

## Requirements
- C Compiler
- Command-line interface to run the assembler program

## How to Use
1. Compile the source code:
`gcc sicasm.c -o sicasm`
`gcc sicxeasm.c -o sicasm`
2. Run the assembler with the input assembly source code file:
`./sicasm SIC_PROG.txt`
`./sicxeasm SIC_XE_PROG.txt`
3. The program will generate two output files:
listing.txt and object.txt

## Error Handling
- Pass 1 Errors:
  - Duplicate symbol: A symbol is defined more than once.
  - Invalid operation: An unrecognized opcode is encountered.
- Pass 2 Errors:
  - Symbol not found: A symbol used in an instruction is not defined in the symbol table.
  - Unable to assemble into Format 3; Format 4 not specified: An instruction's operand requires format 4 addressing but was not specified.

## Sample Programs
- `sicasm.c` Program:
  - Input: `SIC_PROG.txt`
  - Outputs: `sic_immediate.txt`, `sic_listing.txt`, `sic_object.txt`
- `sicxeasm.c` Program:
  - Input: `SIC_XE_PROG.txt`
  - Outputs: `sicxe_immediate.txt`, `sicxe_listing.txt`, `sicxe_object.txt`
